# SDR++ Brown for LibreSDR

This repository is developed specifically for LibreSDR.

It is a LibreSDR-focused SDR++ Brown build rather than a generic Brown fork mirror.

It is intended for LibreSDR boards that expose a PlutoSDR-compatible IIO topology, with special attention to Windows detection, direct network probing, `CS8` support, and `tezuka_fw`-based 8-bit wideband workflows.

If you are looking for the general Brown fork rather than the LibreSDR-oriented build, use the upstream Brown repository instead:

## LibreSDR Special Branch

This branch is a LibreSDR-focused SDR++ Brown build intended for boards that expose PlutoSDR-compatible IIO devices.

What is added in this branch:

* detects LibreSDR more reliably on Windows, including cases where `iio_scan_context` does not return the board but direct `ip:` access works
* accepts LibreSDR-compatible device descriptions instead of relying on a single hardcoded scan string
* keeps per-device settings when the same board is rediscovered under a normalized URI such as `ip:192.168.2.1`
* supports `CS16` and `CS8` IQ streaming modes in the Pluto/LibreSDR source module
* allows sample-rate changes without requiring a full SDR++ restart
* includes a Windows packaging script that collects the actual built modules and runtime DLLs used on this machine

For wideband 8-bit operation, this branch is intended to be used with [`tezuka_fw`](https://github.com/F5OEO/tezuka_fw). That firmware adds a complex 8-bit streaming mode for LibreSDR/ZynqSDR; in practice this branch is prepared for 8-bit operation up to 40 MHz on compatible LibreSDR firmware and network setups.

Build and packaging notes for this LibreSDR-oriented branch are documented in [`docs/libresdr_windows_build.md`](docs/libresdr_windows_build.md).

A Traditional Chinese LibreSDR usage guide is available in [`docs/libresdr_usage_zh-TW.md`](docs/libresdr_usage_zh-TW.md).

## Debugging reminders

* to debug in windows in virtualbox env, download mesa opengl32.dll from https://downloads.fdossena.com/Projects/Mesa3D/Builds/MesaForWindows-x64-20.1.8.7z
* make sure you put rtaudiod.dll in the build folder's root otherwise audio sink will not load.
* use system monitor to debug missing dlls while they fail to load.

## Local Android build:

* put into your ~/.gradle/gradle.properties this line: sdrKitRoot=/home/user/SDRPlusPlus/android-sdr-kit/sdr-kit
  * it can obtained + built from: https://github.com/AlexandreRouma/android-sdr-kit 
  * docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t android-sdr-kit  .
  * docker start android-sdr-kit    # it will exit
  * docker cp be03210da56a:/sdr-kit .    # will create directory with built binary libs, replace be03210da56a with id obtained from 'docker ps -a'
* use jdk11 for gradle in android studio. Android Studio -> Settings -> ... -> Gradle -> Gradle JDK . This is needed if you have various errors with java.io unaccessible fields.
* in case of invalid keystore error (should not happen with jdk11): 
  * you may create new keystore with current jdk version:
    ~/soft/jdk8/bin/keytool -genkey -v -keystore debug2.keystore -storepass android -alias androiddebugkey -keypass android -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
  * use this filename (debug2.keystore) in app/build.gradle along with passwords in the signingConfigs -> debug section.

Good luck.
